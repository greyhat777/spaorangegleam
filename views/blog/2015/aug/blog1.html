<article>
<p class="paragraph">Whether you care about online marketing for your business or not, the reality is, your customers do. It is no longer something even worth questioning; it is a must. From Facebook and Instagram, to Twitter, Blogging and Search Engine Optimized sites for easy online discovery, online marketing is an ever-growing platform, and offers the unique opportunity for business owners to actually engage with their customers. And after all, why not take advantage of something that’s already proven for its convenience, reach, cost, and effectiveness?</p>
<p class="paragraph">Gone are the days of commercials, billboards, phonebooks, and newspaper ads and articles. The age of technology is here, and it’s all around us. If someone needs car service, a haircut, even a new dishwasher, their search begins online. In fact, without Google maps, most of us probably wouldn’t even know where we’re going or how to get there.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Jenny Servis, vice president of marketing for Marketing Solutions Company says,<br/>
“Ten years ago it may have been a choice to jump on the online bandwagon, but now it’s an absolute must to survive and thrive as a small business. With over 85% of searches for products and services happening online, it’s just a “duh” at this point. Being online means having a responsive, search optimized website as well as an engaging and growing following on social media plus using email as part of your marketing mix.”</p>
<p class="paragraph">Too often, business owners ignore the obligation to have an online presence, siting reasons such as not having enough time, not knowing enough about technology, or not having a product or service that’s necessary to offer online, and all these reasons would be valid, if only the reward didn’t so grossly outweigh the risk.</p>
