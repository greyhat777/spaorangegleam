<article>
<p class="paragraph">You’ve probably heard the term SPA which is an acronym for Single Page Application. A search on Google describes SPAs as web apps that load a single HTML page and dynamically update that page as the user interacts with the app. SPAs use Ajax and HTML5 to create fluid and responsive web apps, without constant page reloads. However, this means much of the work happens on the client side, in JavaScript. </p>
<p class="paragraph">Websites traditional built with PHP such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal sites to name a few tend to be slow in comparison, and only get slower as the website grows. This is because unlike SPAs that only load a single HTML page that dynamically updates the page. Each call to a page in a PHP application not dynamic, therefore forcing an HTTP request that slows down the website. With SPA’s a website will always be faster because that data is being loaded into a single HTML page dynamically.</p>

<p class="paragraph">The reason this is so important is because SPAs provide a better user experience. When the user clicks on a link, they don’t have to wait extra seconds for that page to load, that data is fetched and displayed immediately. SPA websites have been described as having the feel of a traditional desktop application, and that’s because of how instant information becomes available.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Single Page Applications are commonly built with Angular, Ember, Backbone, or other JavaScript MVC frameworks. I’ve personally have tried Backbone and Angular, but have focused my development and learning on Angular, because I enjoy working it. I also feel that as a developer, single page application websites are of better quality than traditional PHP websites. Maybe once companies realize how awesome SPA websites are, we will begin to see more of them on the internet. </p>
